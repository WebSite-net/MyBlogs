            <h2>How my pillow connects to world</h2>
            <p>Today, I’m going to talk about something we all have, but don’t usually think about: my pillow.
                It’s soft, comfy, and essential for a good night’s sleep. What does it have to do with
                globalization? Hello, my name is Nairouz Sido and welcome to my first blog post! Today we
                will explore how my pillow became the pillow that I know of. Before I go into the specifics,
                what is globalization? According to my lectures on globalization, different academic disciplines
                have different definitions of what globalization is. Although it lacks a clear "definition," many
                scholars can agree that it shares certain similar elements, including interconnectivity, the
                strengthening of international ties, and the cross-border movement of people, goods, and ideas.
                Globalization is made possible in large part by technological developments in information
                sharing, communication, and transportation. (Stockdale, 2024). </p>

            <p>So what's the connection between globalization and a pillow? The materials used to make my
                pillow came from different areas of the world: the synthetic polyester stuffing was sourced from
                a factory in China, the cotton cover was made in India, and the pillow itself was built in
                Vietnam. It finally made it to the store where I bought it here in Canada after traveling across
                oceans (Campbell, 2024). The journey is a reflection of the vast worldwide supply systems that
                our class has been learning. My pillow would not be around today if international trade hadn't
                been coordinated. Many nations were engaged in the production of the finished product, from
                raw materials to it, demonstrating the interdependence that globalization symbolizes. Crossborder trade
                in goods, services, and technology connects economies and communities in ways
                that are frequently invisible. However, there are environmental consequences associated with
                international shipping, such as resource usage and carbon emissions. Positively, globalization
                makes it possible for citizens of other countries to engage in the global economy, creating jobs in
                the manufacturing, transportation, and retail industries. Despite its apparent simplicity, my
                pillow stands for the worldwide connection that characterizes contemporary life. The next time I
                go to sleep, I'll consider the long journey my pillow traveled, which will serve as a reminder of
                the complex ties that underlie everyday items.</p>
